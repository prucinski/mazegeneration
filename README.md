Assessment directory for DTT.

Deliverables also has the .exe file. It's currently not in .gitignore, but hopefully that's not an issue.
Other than that, I hope you don't have any other issues with this repo :)

In the spreadsheet I have mentioned that you can take a look at my workflow in the commit history. You should have access to that by navigating to the commits page of this repo.
